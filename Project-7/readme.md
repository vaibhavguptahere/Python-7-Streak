# Python 7 Streak - Project 7: Weather Forecast Application 🌤️

This is the seventh and final project in the Python 7 Streak, where I developed a weather forecast application using Python and Tkinter. The app fetches live weather data for cities across India and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features 🛠️:
- Allows the user to select a state and a city from dropdown menus.
- Fetches weather information from the OpenWeather API for the selected city.
- Displays weather conditions, temperature, pressure, and more.
- Provides a clear, easy-to-read interface using Tkinter.

## Learning and Experience 📚:
This project helped me consolidate my understanding of Python's GUI development using Tkinter. I also gained hands-on experience in working with third-party APIs, handling JSON data, and dynamically updating UI elements based on user input.

- **Tkinter**: Used to create a user interface with dropdowns, labels, and buttons.
- **Requests module**: Used to fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Used to handle images in Tkinter.
- **JSON Handling**: Worked with JSON data to extract and display weather details.

The main challenges I encountered included:
- Correctly formatting and displaying temperature data (converted from Kelvin to Celsius) 🌡️.
- Dynamically updating the available cities based on the selected state 🌆.
- Ensuring the UI remains responsive and visually appealing 🎨.

## Modules Used 🧰:
- `tkinter`: For creating the GUI elements (buttons, labels, comboboxes).
- `requests`: To send requests to the OpenWeather API and get the weather data.
- `PIL` (Pillow): For handling images and creating image objects in Tkinter.
- `json`: To parse the JSON response from the API.

## Installation Instructions ⚙️:
To run the Weather Forecast Application, make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following modules:

```bash
pip install requests Pillow
pip install tkinter
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application by executing the Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Conclusion 🎉:
This project marks the completion of my Python 7 Streak. Throughout this journey, I have learned a lot about Python's capabilities in different domains like GUI development, API integration, and data handling. The experience has deepened my understanding of Python and its application in real-world projects.
