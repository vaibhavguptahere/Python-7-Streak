# Python QR Code Generator

This repository contains a simple Python-based QR code generator. The application allows users to create QR codes from text or URLs and save them as image files. This project is a great way to learn about QR codes, image generation, and working with libraries in Python.

## Features

- Generate QR codes from text or URLs
- Save generated QR codes as PNG images
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **qrcode**: A Python library for generating QR codes.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: A Python Imaging Library used to handle image creation and manipulation.

## Installation

To run the QR code generator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]


Here's a sample README file for your Python QR Code Generator project. You can customize it further based on your specific implementations and learning experiences.
