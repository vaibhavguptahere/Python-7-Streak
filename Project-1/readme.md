# Python QR Code Generator

This repository contains a simple Python-based QR code generator. The application allows users to create QR codes from text or URLs and save them as image files. This project is a great way to learn about QR codes, image generation, and working with libraries in Python.

## Features

- Generate QR codes from text or URLs
- Save generated QR codes as PNG images
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **qrcode**: A Python library for generating QR codes.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: A Python Imaging Library used to handle image creation and manipulation.

## Code Structure

- **qr-gen.py**: The main script that handles QR code generation.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## Learning Outcomes

During this project, I learned:

- How to use Python libraries for generating QR codes and handling images.
- The structure of a Python project, including how to organize code and documentation.
- Basic command-line input and output operations in Python.
- How to create user-friendly interfaces, customizing qr code with fill color and background color.
- Best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.

## Installation

To run the QR code generator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
