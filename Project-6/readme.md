# Face Detection Using Python üëÄ

This project demonstrates how to build a simple face detection application using Python. Using the OpenCV library, this program detects faces in real-time through a webcam feed and draws rectangles around them.

## Project Overview üéØ

- **Objective**: Detect faces in a live video feed using a webcam.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `opencv-python`: For image processing and face detection.
  
## Installation üíª

1. First, make sure to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Code Explanation üìù

1. **Load the Cascade Classifier**:
   The code uses a pre-trained classifier provided by OpenCV to detect frontal faces. The `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is used for this purpose.

```python
face_cap = cv2.CascadeClassifier("path_to_haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml")
```

2. **Capture Video Feed**:
   We use OpenCV to capture video from the webcam with `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`.

```python
video_cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
```

3. **Face Detection**:
   The frames from the webcam are converted to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor()` to improve processing speed. The `detectMultiScale()` method is used to detect faces in the video frame.

4. **Draw Rectangles**:
   For each face detected, a green rectangle is drawn around it.

```python
cv2.rectangle(video_data, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
```

5. **Exit the Program**:
   Press the "S" key to stop the video capture.

```python
if cv2.waitKey(10) == ord("s"):
    break
```

## Key Learnings üìö

- **Real-time face detection**: This project helps in understanding how to apply machine learning-based classifiers for real-time image processing.
- **OpenCV library**: Learn how to use OpenCV for computer vision tasks like face detection and video processing.
- **Image processing techniques**: Conversion of images to grayscale for faster processing, and drawing on images in real-time.
