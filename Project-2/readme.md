WhatsApp Message Automation
This project automates the process of sending WhatsApp messages using Python. By scheduling messages with specific content at a desired time, users can ensure timely communication without needing to manually send messages. The script takes user input for phone number, message, and timing and leverages the pywhatkit library to handle message delivery via WhatsApp Web.

Features
Automated Message Scheduling: Set a message to be sent automatically at a specified time.
Customizable Input: Input a phone number, message, and time (in 24-hour format) for flexibility.
Command-Line Interface: User-friendly prompts make it easy to schedule a message directly from the terminal.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used to develop the automation script.
pywhatkit: Python library that enables WhatsApp Web message scheduling and other automation features.
Project Structure
whatsapp_automation.py: The main Python script for scheduling and sending messages.
README.md: Project documentation file.
