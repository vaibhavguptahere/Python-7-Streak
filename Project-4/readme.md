# 🧮 Python Calculator Application

## 📜 Project Overview

This project is the **4th** in my Python project streak 🐍, where I am working to enhance my programming skills by building practical applications. This application is a simple calculator built using Python's Tkinter library for GUI, providing basic arithmetic operations in a user-friendly interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- 📐 **Special Functions**: Percentage calculation, clear functionality, and the ability to handle parenthesis
- 🛡️ **Error Handling**: Displays 'Error' if an invalid input is entered

## 🚀 Learning and Process

Through this project, I learned about:
1. **Tkinter GUI** 🖥️: Using the Tkinter library to create graphical applications in Python. I explored Tkinter components like `Button`, `Entry`, and layout management.
2. **Event Handling** ⚡: How to use lambda functions and the `command` attribute to handle button presses.
3. **Dynamic Display** 🔄: Using `StringVar()` to dynamically update the entry widget to show calculations in real-time.
4. **Error Management** ❌: Implementing `try-except` to handle errors during calculations, improving the application’s robustness.

## 🧩 Code Explanation

The main components of the application include:
1. **Class Structure** 📂: The application is built as a class to keep the functions modular and organized.
2. **Button Configuration** 🎛️: Buttons are placed in a grid layout, each tied to a lambda function for easy event handling.
3. **Operations** ➗: The `solve` function uses `eval()` to compute the result from the entered string expression.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Tkinter if necessary (Tkinter is pre-installed with standard Python installations).
3. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

This will launch the calculator application. 🎉


## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (standard with most Python installations)

## 🎉 Conclusion

This calculator project has helped me understand the foundations of GUI programming in Python and how to develop functional applications. Stay tuned for more projects in my Python streak! 🚀
